# Plate Calculator

> Calculator for minimum amount of weight plates needed to get any value in a given range and precision. A sophisticated web application designed to calculate the minimum number of weight plates needed for any given weight range and precision, specifically designed for DIY gym equipment and home gym optimization.

This application uses advanced algorithms including greedy subset-sum cover and binary heuristic approaches to optimize weight plate denominations. It features interactive 3D visualization using Three.js, realistic plate dimensions with Olympic standard specifications, and supports custom weight ranges from 0-1023kg with adjustable precision from 0.25kg to 5kg.
